    "## Homework 4\n",
    "*For any questions or concerns please email your instructor at `smanna@scu.edu`*\n",
    "### Due - 06/01/2018 - 11:59p - 100 points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name:** `<Alma Niu>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email** `<aniu@scu.edu>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:** \n",
    "* Make you conversant with word embedding using word2vec\n",
    "* Familiarity with `gensim`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:** \n",
    "You are given some amazon reviews on `Musical Instruments`. Your task is to clean your data, separate out sentences, and then use them to train your `word2vec` model. After your model is trained, then you have to compute the following:\n",
    "* print top 10 words based on term frequency (make sure they are not stop-words)\n",
    "* print `most similar` top 5 words for each of the above words\n",
    "* randomly pick 10 words, and print their `similarity` in the format: `similarity between a and b is ____`. If $sim(a,b) = sim(b,a)$, then you should print only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Instructions:** \n",
    "* Please download `hw4.ipynb` and `reviews_Musical_Instruments_5.json` and insert cells in the `hw4.ipynb` to complete your homework and submit the same file to Camino under `Homework` $\\rightarrow$ `hw4`.\n",
    "* Please make sure you type your `Name` and `Email` on top of your submission file in the placeholder above. \n",
    "* Feel free to use your in-class examples `week7-nltk.ipynb` and `week8-word2Vec.ipynb` to work on this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** The original [data](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) contains reviews from amazon on `Musical Instruments`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Honor Code:** You are expected to complete the homework on your own. Solutions might exist elsewhere, but you are not allowed to copy them. "
